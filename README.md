## Mealtracker
*This template does not work on its own*. It is missing the Ionic library, and AngularJS.

To use this, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy and paste this into an existing Cordova project and download a release of Ionic separately.

This is a mobile application that works like Instagram. However, it is suitable for meals.
